# CG with frame Dandelion
a simple implementation of CG functions

   dandelion framework is used to realize soft raster renderer, parallel optimization of rendering, BVH collision detection, forward Euler, backward Euler, semi-implicit Euler method, fourth-order Rung-Kuta method to simulate motion, and local operation based on half edge network.
   
dandelion's related framework is located: https://github.com/XJTU-Graphics/dandelion

For building, see the dandelion framework's developer documentation at: https://dandelion-docs.readthedocs.io/zh-cn/latest/

I've basically done a shadow mapping based shadowing implementation, with the semi-finished ones in the relevant folders.
